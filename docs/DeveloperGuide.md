## **Acknowledgements**

We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of GitHub Copilot in the development of ContactSwift. This AI programming assistant provided code suggestions and snippets that expedited our development process sometimes. It's important to clarify, though, that the fundamental ideas and high-level concepts of this project are entirely our own creation. Very often, we had to modify or rewrite or fix the code generated by Copilot to ensure it meets our project's requirements and standards.

Additionally, we introduced a basic tasklist feature for each employee, a concept inspired by innovations in the industry, yet developed entirely with original code by our team to ensure it uniquely meets our product's standards and requirements.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EmployeeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Employee` object residing in the `Model`.

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a employee).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Employee` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEmployeeList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Employee` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Employee` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Employee` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Command Implementation

The `AddCommand` implements the abstract class `Command` to add a new `Employee` to the `Model`.

Given below is how the `AddCommand` operates:

Step 1. After the user inputs all the `prefixes` necessary, which are `Name`, `Phone`, `Address`, `Email`, `Team`, `Role`, and optionally `Tag`, the `AddCommandParser` parses the input and creates a new `Employee` for the `AddCommand`.

Step 2. The `AddCommand` will then store the added `Employee` and feed it to the `execute` method.

Step 3. The `execute` method then gives the `Employee` parameter to the `addEmployee` method under the `Model` interface.

Step 4. The `addEmployee` adds the `Employee` to the `Model`.

The following class diagram shows the structure of an `Employee`:

<puml src="diagrams/UpdatedEmployeeClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

And this is the sequence diagram that describes the steps:

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" />

#### Design considerations:

- **Alternative:** `Team` and `Role` could have been further abstracted into a Class called `Header` as they appear above the names of the `Employee` in the GUI. This was considered so that we could filter the contact list to employees who are in the same team or role. However, it is rejected as filter will be able to be implemented in a simpler manner when avoiding this over-abstraction.

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Unique Identifier (UID) Implementation

The introduction of Unique Identifiers (UID) marks a significant enhancement in managing employee records, ensuring the uniqueness of each entry and preventing duplicates. This section elaborates on the UID system's integration into the application, focusing on the deletion process and the assignment of teams and roles.

- UID Assignment: Every employee added to the contact book is automatically assigned a unique identifier (UID). This UID serves as a definitive reference to each employee, distinguishing between individuals even if other attributes (such as name, email, and contact number) are identical.
  The UID is generated sequentially, starting from `DEFAULT_BASE_UID` for the first employee and incrementing by one for each subsequent addition. This systematic approach ensures that each employee is uniquely identified within the system. To work with exisiting data, UID is set to the last UID in the data, which is also the maximum UID. Furthermore, the UID is displayed alongside the employee's details in the contact list, providing users with a clear and unambiguous reference point for each entry.

- Enhanced Duplicate Detection: The system leverages UIDs to identify and prevent duplicate entries. Upon adding a new employee, the application checks for duplicates based on a combination of name, email, and contact number. If a potential duplicate is detected, the system relies on the UID to ascertain uniqueness, thereby maintaining the integrity of the employee database.

- Loading Data: When loading data, the only catch is if the data has been tampered with and the UIDs have duplicates. In this case, the application will throw an error and refuse to load the data. Instead, the data loaded would be the template data. In future iterations, the application could be enhanced to handle such cases by reassigning UIDs to the data.

#### Implications

One of the major ways the UID system enhances the application is by streamlining the deletion process. When a user initiates the deletion of an employee, the system prompts the user to specify the deletion target using the employee's UID. This approach eliminates ambiguity and ensures that the correct employee is removed from the database, even in cases where multiple employees share the same name, email, or contact number.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design**: Integrating UIDs enhances the robustness and reliability of the employee management system. It addresses the challenge of duplicate entries and streamlines the process of deleting, team assignment, and role designation, ensuring accuracy and precision in employee record management. In the future, the UID system can be further extended to support additional functionalities such as search, filtering, and sorting, providing users with a more robust and efficient employee management experience.

- **Alternatives considered**: While alternatives such as relying solely on name, email, or contact number for identification were considered, these methods were prone to ambiguity and errors, especially in large datasets. The UID approach was selected for its ability to uniquely identify each employee, thereby enhancing the system's overall functionality and user experience.

### Delete by Name Command Implementation

The `DeleteCommand` was further enhanced to allow users to remove employees from the list by their full name. This functionality is crucial for users who need to manage their employee datasets. The command has been enhanced to handle deletion by name in case of duplicate names.

- `DeleteCommandParser` parses the user input and creates a `DeleteCommand` object with a specific target name that encapsulates the deletion logic.
- `Model#deleteEmployee(Employee target)` is then called to remove the employee from the list according to the given criteria.
- In the scenario where multiple employees have the same name, the user is prompted to delete by uid to ensure the correct employee is removed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete by name mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `delete John Doe`, intending to remove the employee named John Doe. The input is parsed by `DeleteCommandParser`, which creates a `DeleteCommand` with the target name.

Step 2. The `DeleteCommand` is executed, calling `Model#deleteEmployee(target)`, where `target` is the employee with the name "John Doe". If there are multiple employees with the name "John Doe", a `CommandException` is thrown asking the user to delete by uid.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design:** The command pattern is used for consistency with other commands in the application and to keep the parsing and execution logic separated. The use of target name for deletion allows for precise and flexible removal of employees without hard-coding specific deletion types.
- **Alternatives considered:** A direct approach where the `DeleteCommand` directly manipulates the employee list was considered but rejected to maintain a clean separation between the command and the model, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Delete by UID Command Implementation

The `DeleteCommand` is also implemented to allow users to remove employees from the list by their unique id. This functionality is crucial for users who need to manage their employee datasets, especially when there are multiple employees with the same name.

- `DeleteCommandParser` parses the user input and creates a `DeleteCommand` object with a specific target uid that encapsulates the deletion logic.
- `Model#deleteEmployee(Employee target)` is then called to remove the employee from the list according to the given criteria.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete by uid mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `delete uid/1234`, intending to remove the employee with uid 1234. The input is parsed by `DeleteCommandParser`, which creates a `DeleteCommand` with the target uid.

Step 2. The `DeleteCommand` is executed, calling `Model#deleteEmployee(target)`, where `target` is the employee with the uid 1234.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design:** The command pattern is used for consistency with other commands in the application and to keep the parsing and execution logic separated. The use of target uid for deletion allows for precise and flexible removal of employees without hard-coding specific deletion types.
- **Alternatives considered:** A direct approach where the `DeleteCommand` directly manipulates the employee list was considered but rejected to maintain a clean separation between the command and the model, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Filter Command Implementation

The `FilterCommand` allows users to refine the list of employees displayed based on specified criteria such as name, role, team, and tags. This functionality is pivotal for efficiently managing large datasets of employees and ensuring that users can easily access subsets of employee data that meet specific criteria.

#### Implementation Details

- **Parsing Input**: The `FilterCommandParser` parses the user input and constructs a `FilterCommand` object. This object includes a predicate representing the filtering criteria based on the user's command input.
- **Applying the Filter**: The `FilterCommand` executes using the `Model#updateFilteredEmployeeList(Predicate<Employee> predicate)` method, which applies the constructed predicate to filter the employee list in the model.

#### Example Usage Scenario

1. **User Input**: The user types the command `filter t/developer`, intending to display employees tagged as developers.
2. **Parsing Command**: The `FilterCommandParser` interprets the input and constructs a predicate that matches employees whose tags include "developer".
3. **Executing Command**: The `FilterCommand` is executed, which invokes `Model#updateFilteredEmployeeList(predicate)` with the predicate to filter the list. Only employees with the "developer" tag are now shown in the user interface.

#### Design Considerations

- **Command Pattern**: We employ the command pattern to maintain consistency with other command implementations in the application. This pattern also helps separate the parsing logic from the execution logic, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Use of Predicates**: Using predicates for filtering maximizes flexibility and scalability. It allows the filter command to handle various filtering criteria dynamically, without needing to hard-code specific query logic.
- **Alternative Approaches**: Initially, a direct manipulation approach was considered, where `FilterCommand` would directly modify the employee list. However, this approach was discarded in favor of using the model to handle list manipulations, ensuring that all list state changes remain centralized and manageable through the model, enhancing maintainability and testability.

#### Filtering Capabilities Explained

- **Flexible Criteria**: Employees can be filtered by name, tags, role, and team. Each parameter (e.g., `n/NAME`, `t/TAG`, `r/ROLE`, `T/TEAM`) is optional, but at least one must be specified.
- **Complex Queries**: The system supports AND conditions within the same filter type and single conditions for different types. For instance, filtering by `t/friend t/colleague` will show employees tagged both as "friend" and "colleague".
- **Case Sensitivity**: Role and tag searches are case-sensitive, requiring exact matches, whereas name and team fields are case-insensitive.

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### TaskList Feature

#### Implementation

The `TaskList` feature is facilitated by the `TaskList` class, located in the `src/main/java/seedu/address/model/tasklist` directory. It maintains a list of `Task` objects, each representing a task assigned to an employee.

The `Task` class, located in the `src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task` directory, represents a task with a `Description` and a `done` status. The `Description` class encapsulates the details of the task.

The `Employee` class, located in the `src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee` directory, contains a `TaskList` object. This allows each employee to have their own list of tasks.

- `Employee#addTask(Description description)`â€‰â€”â€‰Creates a new task with the given description and adds it to the employee's task list.
- `Employee#getTaskList()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns the employee's task list.
- `Employee#getTask(int taskNumber)`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns the task at the specified index in the employee's task list.

#### Design Considerations

- **Aspect:** Representation of tasks in the `Employee` class

  - **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each `Employee` object has a `TaskList` object.
    - Pros: Allows for encapsulation of task-related behaviors in the `TaskList` class. Simplifies the `Employee` class.
    - Cons: Requires additional methods in the `Employee` class to interact with the `TaskList`.
  - **Alternative 2:** Each `Employee` object has a `List<Task>` object.
    - Pros: Simplifies the `Employee` class as there is no need for task-related methods.
    - Cons: Does not allow for encapsulation of task-related behaviors. Makes the `Employee` class more complex.

- **Aspect:** Storage of tasks
  - **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Tasks are stored as a list in the `TaskList` class.
    - Pros: Allows for easy addition, removal, and retrieval of tasks. Supports ordering of tasks.
    - Cons: Does not support efficient search or lookup of tasks.
  - **Alternative 2:** Tasks are stored as a set in the `TaskList` class.
    - Pros: Supports efficient search or lookup of tasks.
    - Cons: Does not support ordering of tasks. Makes addition, removal, and retrieval of tasks more complex.

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Add Task Feature Implementation

The `AddTask` feature is implemented to allow users to add tasks to each employee. This functionality is crucial for users who need to assign tasks to each employee.

- `AddTaskCommandParser` parses the user input and creates an `AddTaskCommand` object with the specific task details, namely UniqueId of the Employee, and the Description of the task.

- `Employee#addTask(int employeeId, Description task)` is then called to add the task to the specified employee's task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `addtask uid/1 Buy milk`, intending to add the task "Buy milk" to the first employee in the list. The input is parsed by `AddTaskCommandParser`, which creates an `AddTaskCommand` with the employee ID and the task details.

Step 2. The `AddTaskCommand` is executed, calling `Employee#addTask(description)`, where `description` is the new description of the new task to be added.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design:** The command pattern is used for consistency with other commands in the application and to keep the parsing and execution logic separated. The use of a separate `TaskList` for each employee allows for flexible and dynamic task management without hard-coding specific task types.

- **Alternatives considered:** A direct approach where the `AddTaskCommand` directly manipulates the employee's task list was considered but rejected to maintain a clean separation between the command and the model, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Delete Task Feature Implementation

The `DeleteTask` feature is implemented to allow users to remove tasks from each employee's task list. This functionality is crucial for users who need to manage the tasks assigned to each employee.

- `DeleteTaskCommandParser` parses the user input and creates a `DeleteTaskCommand` object with the specific task index and the UniqueId of the Employee.

- `Employee#deleteTask(int taskIndex)` is then called to remove the task from the specified employee's task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `deletetask uid/1 1`, intending to remove the first task from the first employee in the list. The input is parsed by `DeleteTaskCommandParser`, which creates a `DeleteTaskCommand` with the employee ID and the task index.

Step 2. The `DeleteTaskCommand` is executed, calling `Employee#deleteTask(taskIndex)`, where `taskIndex` is the index of the task to be removed.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design:** The command pattern is used for consistency with other commands in the application and to keep the parsing and execution logic separated. The use of a separate `TaskList` for each employee allows for flexible and dynamic task management without hard-coding specific task types.

- **Alternatives considered:** A direct approach where the `DeleteTaskCommand` directly manipulates the employee's task list was considered but rejected to maintain a clean separation between the command and the model, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Mark Task Feature Implementation

The `MarkTask` feature is implemented to allow users to mark tasks as done for each employee. This functionality is crucial for users who need to track the completion of tasks assigned to each employee.

- `MarkTaskCommandParser` parses the user input and creates a `MarkTaskCommand` object with the specific task index and the UniqueId of the Employee.
- `TaskList#markTask(int taskIndex)` is then called to mark the task as done in the specified employee's task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mark task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `mark uid/1 1`, intending to mark the first task of the first employee in the list as done. The input is parsed by `MarkTaskCommandParser`, which creates a `MarkTaskCommand` with the employee ID and the task index.

Step 2. The `MarkTaskCommand` is executed, calling `TaskList#markTask(taskIndex)`, where `taskIndex` is the index of the task to be marked as done.

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Unmark Task Feature Implementation

The `UnmarkTask` feature is implemented to allow users to unmark tasks as done for each employee. This functionality is crucial for users who need to track the completion of tasks assigned to each employee.

- `UnmarkTaskCommandParser` parses the user input and creates a `UnmarkTaskCommand` object with the specific task index and the UniqueId of the Employee.
- `TaskList#unmarkTask(int taskIndex)` is then called to unmark the task as done in the specified employee's task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the unmark task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `unmark uid/1 1`, intending to unmark the first task of the first employee in the list as done. The input is parsed by `UnmarkTaskCommandParser`, which creates a `UnmarkTaskCommand` with the employee ID and the task index.

Step 2. The `UnmarkTaskCommand` is executed, calling `TaskList#unmarkTask(taskIndex)`, where `taskIndex` is the index of the task to be unmarked as done.

#### Design Considerations

- **Why this design:** The command pattern is used for consistency with other commands in the application and to keep the parsing and execution logic separated. The use of a separate `TaskList` for each employee allows for flexible and dynamic task management without hard-coding specific task types.
- **Alternatives considered:** A direct approach where the `MarkTaskCommand` and `UnmarkTaskCommand` directly manipulate the employee's task list was considered but rejected to maintain a clean separation between the command and the model, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

## **Proposed**

### Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th employee in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new employee. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the employee was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the employee being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team Size: 4**

1. **Automatically Refresh UI on Task List Updates**: Currently, the UI does not refresh automatically when a user performs any task-related actions (e.g., adding or deleting a task) for an employee, requiring manual refreshing to see updates. We plan to modify the system to automatically refresh the UI once any task list-related action is completed, improving real-time data accuracy and user experience.

2. **Rewrite UIDs to Resolve Duplicates**: The system currently faces issues with duplicate UIDs (resorting to only showing the template data if the actual data has duplicate UIDs), which can lead to data integrity problems. We intend to implement a UID rewriting mechanism that activates upon detecting duplicate UIDs during data operations. This enhancement will ensure each entry has a unique identifier, thereby preventing data conflicts and potential errors during data processing.

3. **Replace/Rewrite UIDs which overflow**: The system currently faces issues with UIDs overflowing (after Java's Integer Max Value), which can lead to data integrity problems. We intend to implement a UID rewriting mechanism that activates upon detecting overflowed UIDs during data operations. This enhancement will ensure each entry has a unique identifier, thereby preventing data conflicts and potential errors during data processing.

4. **Detailed Notifications for Corrupted Data**: When encountering corrupted data, the system currently loads either blank or template data, without informing the user regarding the nature of the corruption. We plan to enhance this by providing detailed notifications that describe the exact issues with the corrupted data. For example, if a data corruption issue occurs due to format errors in a file, the system will specify which part of the data is incorrect and suggest possible actions to rectify the error.

5. **Color-Coded Tags for Better Visibility**: Currently, all tags in the UI are displayed in the same color, which can make it difficult for users to quickly distinguish between different categories or priorities. We plan to enhance the UI by introducing color-coded tags, allowing users to assign specific colors to different tags. This will improve user interaction by making it easier to manage and recognize tags visually.

6. **Enhanced Task List Display on Employee Cards**: The task lists on employee cards are currently presented as plain text, which does not provide an optimal user experience. We intend to redesign the task list display to be more visually appealing and interactive, making improvements such as dividing tasks by completed and uncompleted, for better organization and readability.

7. **Truncate Employee Information to prevent UI overflow**: Currently, the UI displays all employee information in full, which can lead to overflow if there is too long of a name, too many tags, or anything of this nature. We plan to implement a truncation mechanism that limits the display of employee information to a certain number of characters, ensuring that the UI remains clean and organized. Users can then expand the information to view the full details as needed. Also in this scenario, the UID will be moved to the top of the Employee card for easier visibility.

8. **Allow non-alphanumeric characters in task descriptions**: Currently, task descriptions are limited to alphanumeric characters, which can be restrictive for users who need to include special characters or symbols in their task descriptions. We plan to enhance the system to allow non-alphanumeric characters in task descriptions, providing users with greater flexibility and customization options when creating and managing tasks.
